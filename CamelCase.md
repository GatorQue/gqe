Camel-case is used when there are no spaces allowed in a variable or function name.  Since underscores are difficult to key correctly, camel-case is often preferred for styles of source code authoring.

The way a variable name is entered is usually starting with an uppercase letter and followed by lowercase letters for the remainder of the word.  Additional words are added with the same pattern of uppercase followed by lowercase omitting any spaces and underscores.
