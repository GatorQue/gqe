/**
 * Provides the StateManager class in the GQE namespace which is responsible
 * for providing the State management facilities to the App base class used in
 * the GQE core library.
 *
 * @file src/GQE/Core/classes/StateManager.cpp
 * @author Ryan Lindeman
 * @date 20100728 - Initial Release
 * @date 20110120 - Added ability to add inactive states and initialize them
 *                  when they become active and send Dialog signal events.
 * @date 20110120 - Add ability to drop active state as inactive state
 * @date 20110125 - IState::HandleCleanup is now called from here
 * @date 20110127 - Moved to GQE Core library and src directory
 * @date 20110218 - Change mDropped to mDead to remove potential confusion
 * @date 20110218 - Added InactivateActiveState and ResetActiveState methods
 * @date 20110218 - Change to system include style
 * @date 20110611 - Convert logging to new Log macros
 * @date 20110627 - Removed extra ; from namespace
