 * @date 20110627 - Removed extra ; from namespace
 * @date 20110721 - Remove * from GetAsset() calls since it now returns TYPE&
 * @date 20110906 - Change mApp from a pointer to an address reference
 * @date 20120322 - Support new SFML2 snapshot changes
 * @date 20120512 - Renamed App to IApp since it really is just an interface
