/**
 * Provides the ILogger class in the GQE namespace which is responsible for
 * providing the ILogger interface used by all loggers in the GQE core library.
 *
 * @file src/GQE/Core/interfaces/ILogger.cpp
 * @author Ryan Lindeman
 * @date 20110801 - Initial Release
 * @date 20120426 - Change to ILogger::GetLogger call instead of gLogger
 * @date 20120504 - Fix segfault caused by SLOG taking over gInstance
 * @date 20120512 - Renamed App to IApp since it really is just an interface
