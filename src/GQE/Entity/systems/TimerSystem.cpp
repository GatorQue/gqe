/**
* @class GQE::TimerSystem
* @ingroup Entity
* The TimerSystem class is used to make timed events. The properties provided
* by this System are as follows:
* - Timers: A map of TimeContext structure.
* This class is very simple. It Iterates through each entitys list of timers and checks to see if they are triggerd.
