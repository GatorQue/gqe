# Introduction #

Every project will sink or swim depending on how its managed. Many great computer games were lost due to poor project management. Project management does not need to be formal to be successful. Many projects, including Windows XP, were managed using less formal methods.

Take time at the beginning of each project to determine the best way to manage your project and stick to your project plan as much as you can. Here are a few questions you might want to ask yourself to determine which project planning method you should use.

  * Is this a short term project lasting no more than a few days to a couple of weeks?
  * Is this a mid range project that will last no longer than a couple of months?
  * Is this a long term project that will take between six months to two years to complete?
  * Is this a quick project that you will be focusing on each day?
  * Is this a project that will have many interruptions between development sessions? (Consider dividing your tasks into very small manageable subtasks and use [Trello](http://trello.com/) to keep track of each task and subtask in progress)

Hopefully these questions have stimulated some thought into how you want to manage your project. You may also want to consider using a version control system for the source code of your project if it is longer than a few days. Version control systems allow you to undo code changes you made at 2 in the morning that broke everything that was working the night before.
