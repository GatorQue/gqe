# General guidelines for editing the wiki #

## Main rules ##

This wiki is maintained by the GQE community, and as a consequence you are allowed (and encouraged) to edit or add any relevant contribution. However, it is recommended to follow the general organization and page layout, in order to keep a consistent and pleasant wiki for all. In other words, don't put your source code under the //tutorials// section :-)

Except the general index pages which are read-only, there's no restriction on creating or editing pages ; you can even create new categories for subjects that don't exist yet, if you think it's worth sharing.

You are also free to edit pages created by other users, if you have relevant additions or corrections to make.

## Contents ##

You are encouraged to share anything related to GQE with no restriction : tutorials, source codes, links, tips and tricks, personal projects, ... as long as you find it relevant.

The wiki syntax is fully explained on [WikiSyntax](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax).

## Major modifications ##

If you have requests, suggestions or questions about the index pages, the main layout of the wiki, or anything you can't edit directly, feel free to contact the GQE author(s).
