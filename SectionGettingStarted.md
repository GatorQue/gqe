The two hardest parts of any project is a) getting started and b) finishing. This section has been added to help you with the first problem which is to help you quickly get up and running with minimal fuss. Please don't hesitate to tell me how we can make getting started easier for your next project.

The reason that getting started is so hard is because of the work involved in getting your development environment setup can be daunting and less fun than the work involved in developing your game. But taking time at the beginning of every project to think about your project and setup your development tools can save you spending time on these tasks in the middle of your development cycle later on. Take some time to review the following sections before moving on to the tutorials on using GQE below if you're just getting started.
