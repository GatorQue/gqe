/**
 * Provides the basic_nullbuf and basic_onullstream needed to create an
 * ostream that will output to nothing.  The class is added to the std
 * namespace for compatibility reasons.  This class is used by several
 * Logger classes.

 * @file include/GQE/Core/loggers/onullstream
 * @author Ryan Lindeman
 * @date 20110524 - Initial Release
 * @date 20120829 - Fix obscure gcc compiler bug when calling basic_ios::init
