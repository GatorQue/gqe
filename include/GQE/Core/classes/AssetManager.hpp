/**
 * @class GQE::AssetManager
 * @ingroup Core
 * The AssetManager class provides a central class for managing game
 * application assets.  Assets might include but are not limited to:
 * Fonts, Images, Music, Sounds, etc.  The AssetManager collects a
 * list of requested game assets and allows the background loading of
 * these assets as necessary.  The AssetManager can also load these
 * assets in the foreground if specified.  The AssetManager also
 * manages the removal of shared assets as soon as it becomes clear that
 * the game asset is no longer in use by using internal reference counts
 * for each game asset requested.
