 * The App class is at the heart of every game engine in GQ Engines. Its'
 * purpose is to provide the basic game loop control and as a central
 * location for all Manager classes.  Each individual game state will have
 * access to the App class so it can access these Manager classes.  The
 * App class can be easily subclassed to provide custom Manager classes
 * for the specific game genre needed.
