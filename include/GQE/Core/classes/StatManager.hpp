/**
 * Provides the StatManager class in the GQE namespace which is responsible
 * for collecting and providing Statistical information about the application.
 * This information includes, the current Updates per second and Frames per
 * second and other statistics.
 *
 * @file include/GQE/Core/classes/StatManager.hpp
 * @author Ryan Lindeman
 * @date 20110128 - Initial Release
 * @date 20110128 - Moved to GQE Core library and include directory
 * @date 20110131 - Added class and method argument documentation
 * @date 20110218 - Add SFML 2.0 support
 * @date 20110218 - Change to system include style
 * @date 20110625 - Added UpdateVariable and changed Update to UpdateFixed
 * @date 20110627 - Removed extra ; from namespace
 * @date 20120421 - Use arial.ttf font since SFML 2 crashes on exit when using default font
 * @date 20120518 - Use sf::Font instead of FontAsset to remove circular dependency
