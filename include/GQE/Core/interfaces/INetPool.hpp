 * The INetPool class is responsible for defining the interface of a class that
 * will provide a pool of preallocated network packets to be used by the
 * INetEngine and associated network classes. All network packets will be
 * returned to the INetPool derived class after they have been processed which
 * reduces allocation time and improves network performance. The default
 * implementation for the INetEngine interface is the NetPool class.
