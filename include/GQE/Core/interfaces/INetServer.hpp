/**
 * @class GQE::INetServer
 * @ingroup Core
 * The INetServer class is responsible for providing both TCP and UDP server
 * services for the NetManager class. The INetServer class implements only the
 * essential messages necessary to allow for an INetClient class to connect,
 * disconnect, acknowledge messages, and time synchronize itself with each
 * client. It is expected that the programmer will inherit from the INetServer
 * class and provide their own message types specific to their application.
