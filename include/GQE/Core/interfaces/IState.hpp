/**
 * Provides the IState class in the GQE namespace which is responsible for
 * providing the IState interface used in the GQE core library.
 *
 * @file include/GQE/Core/interfaces/IState.hpp
 * @author Ryan Lindeman
 * @date 20100705 - Initial Release
 * @date 20110125 - Use stringstream for UPS/FPS display
 * @date 20110127 - Moved to GQE Core library and include directory
 * @date 20110127 - Use new OS independent Uint/Int types
 * @date 20110128 - Moved UPS/FPS calculations to StatManager.
 * @date 20110131 - Added class and method argument documentation
 * @date 20110218 - Added ReInit method for StateManager::ResetActiveState
 * @date 20110218 - Reset our Cleanup flag after HandleCleanup is called and
 *                  call HandleCleanup in DoInit if cleanup flag is set.
 * @date 20110218 - Change to system include style
 * @date 20110611 - Convert logging to new Log macros
 * @date 20110625 - Added UpdateVariable and changed Update to UpdateFixed
 * @date 20110627 - Removed extra ; from namespace
 * @date 20110801 - Moved code to .cpp file due to circular dependencies
