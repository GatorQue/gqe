/**
 * The ISystem interface class defines a useful system that can be used for all
 * registered IEntity classes. This includes a RenderSystem, CollisionSystem,
 * MovementSystem, AnimationSystem, etc.
 *
 * @file include/GQE/Entity/interfaces/ISystem.hpp
 * @author Jacob Dix
 * @date 20120417 - Initial Release
 * @date 20120618 - Use IEntity not Instance and changed AddPrototype to AddProperties
 * @date 20120620 - Drop ourselves from registered IEntity classes
 * @date 20120622 - Added EraseSystem, DropAllEntities and fixed comments and changed
 *                  HandleInit and HandleCleanup to be called during AddEntity and
 *                  EraseEntity.
 * @date 20120623 - Adjusted scope of some ISystem variables
