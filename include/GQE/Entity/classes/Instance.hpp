 * @class GQE::Instance
 * @ingroup Entity
 * The Instance class represents an IEntity derived class that was produced by
 * the Prototype class which also derives from IEntity. By making a Prototype
 * class and using its MakeInstance call you can create multiple copies of the
 * Prototype class.
