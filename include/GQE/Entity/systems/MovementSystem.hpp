/**
 * @class GQE::MovementSystem
 * @ingroup Entity
 * The MovementSystem class is used to update the IElement position based on the
 * following properties it provides:
 * - bFixedMovement: A boolean indicating fixed movement math should be used
 * - bScreenWrap: A boolean indicating that the position should wrap from one side to the other
 * - fRotationalVelocity: The float representing the rotational velocity of this IEntity
 * - fRotationalAcceleration: The float representing the rotational velocity of this IEntity
 * - vAcceleration: The sf::Vector2f representing the acceleration of this IEntity
 * - vVelocity: The sf::Vector2f representing the velocity of this IEntity
 * The MovementSystem class makes use of the following properties provided by the
 * RenderSystem class:
 * - fRotation: The float representing the current IEntity rotation
 * - rSpriteRect: To determine when to perform screen wrap around
 * - vPosition: The sf::Vector2f representing the current IEntity position
 * If the FixedMovement property is true then the following math is used in the
 * UpdateFixed method:
 * vVelocity += vAcceleration
 * vPosition += vVelocity
 * fRotationalVelocity += fRotationalAcceleration
 * fRotation += fRotationalVelocity
 * If the FixedMovement property is false then the following math is used in
 * the UpdateVariable method:
 * vVelocity += vAcceleration * theElapsedTime
 * vPosition += vVelocity * theElapsedTime
 * fRotationalVelocity += fRotationalAcceleration * theElapsedTime
 * fRotation += fRotationalVelocity * theElapsedTime
