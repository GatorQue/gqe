/**
 * @class GQE::MovementSystem
 * @ingroup Entity
 * The MovementSystem class is used to update the IElement position based on the
 * following properties it provides:
 * - Velocity: The sf::Vector2f representing the velocity of this IEntity
 * - Acceleration: The sf::Vector2f representing the acceleration of this IEntity
 * - RotationalVelocity: The float representing the rotational velocity of this IEntity
 * - RotationalAcceleration: The float representing the rotational velocity of this IEntity
 * - ScreenWrap: A boolean indicating that the position should wrap from one side to the other
 * - FixedMovement: A boolean indicating fixed movement math should be used
 * The MovementSystem class makes use of the following properties provided by the
 * RenderSystem class:
 * - Position: The sf::Vector2f representing the current IEntity position
 * - Rotation: The float representing the current IEntity rotation
 * - SpriteRect: To determine when to perform screen wrap around
 * If the FixedMovement property is true then the following math is used in the
 * UpdateFixed method:
 * Velocity += Acceleration
 * Position += Velocity
 * RotationalVelocity += RotationalAcceleration
 * Rotation += RotationalVelocity
 * If the FixedMovement property is false then the following math is used in
 * the UpdateVariable method:
 * Velocity += Acceleration * theElapsedTime
 * Position += Velocity * theElapsedTime
 * RotationalVelocity += RotationalAcceleration * theElapsedTime
 * Rotation += RotationalVelocity * theElapsedTime
