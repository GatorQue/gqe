/**
 * @class GQE::AnimationSystem
 * @ingroup Entity
 * The AnimationSystem class is used to update the SpriteRect property of each
 * IEntity to cause its Sprite image to show animation. The properties provided
 * by this ISystem are as follows:
 * - FrameClock: The sf::Clock which keeps track of when IEntity was last animated
 * - fFrameDelay: The float which determines in seconds when to animate next
 * - vFrameModifier: The sf::Vector2u to determine the next animation frame to use
 * - rFrameRect: The sf::IntRect which acounts for the animation boundaries
 * The AnimationSystem class makes use of the following properties provided by the
 * RenderSystem class:
 * - rSpriteRect: The sf::IntRect currently being shown
 * The math involved is essentially this:
 * rSpriteRect.x += (rSpriteRect.Width*FrameModifier.x)
 * rSpriteRect.y += (rSpriteRect.Height*FrameModifier.y)
 * And the resulting rSpriteRect.x and rSpriteRect.y values are limited to
 * rFrameRect.x and rFrameRect.y. Your vFrameModifier values will typically be set
 * to x=1,y=0 or vice-versa depending on how your animations are organized
 * (horizontal or vertical).
