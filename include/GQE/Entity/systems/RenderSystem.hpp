/**
 * @class GQE::RenderSystem
 * @ingroup Entity
 * The RenderSystem class is used to render each IEntity as a Sprite and
 * provides the following properties (which are used in other ISystem classes):
 * - bVisible: A boolean indicating this IEntity is currently visible
 * - fRotation: The float representing the current IEntity rotation
 * - rTextureRect: The sf::IntRect to use on the Texture provided
 * - vOrigin: The sf::Vector2f representing the origin for all transformations
 * - vPosition: The sf::Vector2f representing the current IEntity position
 * - vScale: The sf::Vector2f representing the scale to apply to the Image (defaults to 1.0,1.0)
 * - Texture: The sf::Texture to display
 * The RenderSystem can be combined with the MovementSystem to cause each
 * IEntity to be moved around in the game.
