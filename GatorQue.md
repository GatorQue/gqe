GatorQue is the nickname of the original author of the basic game engine.

# Introduction #

Ryan Lindeman has been writing software as a hobby for over 20+ years.  His primary interests are in writing computer games in his spare time.  This project was created to make a game engine that could be easily extended to any game genre you are interested in writing without having to relearn a new game engine.  The hope is that you can quickly jump in and focus on the game mechanics of your new game and focus less on the game engine structure to support the game your writing.  All major components will be found in the game engine and customized for the specific genre you are creating.
