<h2>Engine</h2>
<h3>Installation & Setup</h3>
Everything that has to do with getting the GQE up and running!<br>
<ol><li>Download the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gqe/downloads/detail?name=GQE-v0_10.zip'>newest version</a> of GQE in the '<a href='http://code.google.com/p/gqe/downloads/list'>Downloads</a>' tab of this Google-Code site.<br>
</li><li>Unzip it with your favorite application or use the open source <a href='http://www.7-zip.org/'>7zip</a>.<br>
</li><li>Choose your favorite IDE and compiler. The following sections will show how to setup diffrent IDEs.</li></ol>

<h4>Microsoft Visual Studio (2010)</h4>
<ol><li>Download & Install<br>
<ul><li>Get a free version of <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/germany/express/download/default.aspx'>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express</a>
</li><li>Purchase the <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/germany/visualstudio/products/team/visual-studio-professional.aspx'>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional</a>
</li></ul></li><li>Download the compatible SFML version, that would be <a href='http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sfml/SFML-1.6-sdk-windows-vc2008.zip'>SFML 1.6</a>.<br>
</li><li>Unzip the SFML to a folder of your own choosing.<br>
</li><li>Create a new empty project.<br>
</li><li>Copy the content of GQE to your project folder (only 'include' and 'src' are needed).<br>
</li><li>Add the 'src' folder to the 'Source Files' entry and the 'include' folder to the 'Header Files' entry. I suggest to drag the whole folders to the entries but adding every single file one by one will work too. (Image 1)<br>
</li><li>Configure the project (include-, source- and librarypath & the needed SFML libraries) as shown in image 2.<br>
</li><li>Copy the example file to the main folder and add it to the project.<br>
