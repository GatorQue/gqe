# Introduction #

The first task for any project is setting up _your_ ideal development environment. A development environment includes all the tools you need to work on your project. It can be simple (e.g. an editor and compiler) or complicated (version control, unit testing, IDE, etc).

# Details #

Most simple development environments contain only the following tools:
  * A compiler ([MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/),[D](http://www.d-programming-language.org/dcompiler.html)) or Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short ([CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), [Visual Studio 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express))
  * A good text editor ([Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [VIM](http://www.vim.org/))
  * A language reference book or website ([CppReference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp), [CPlusPlus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/))

While more complicated development environments contain the following additional tools:
  * A build tool ([CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), [scons](http://www.scons.org/), [gnumake](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), etc)
  * A version tracking program (e.g. [GIT](http://git-scm.com/), [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/), [SVN](http://subversion.apache.org/), etc)
  * An issue tracking program ([Trello](http://trello.com/), [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/), [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/), etc)
  * A testing tool ([Google Test](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/), [CppUnit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/), etc)
  * A graphics editor program ([Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), [Photoshop Elements](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html), Paint, etc) or clipart website
  * A comparison tool (e.g. [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/), [BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/), diff, etc)
  * Other 3rd party tools

In any case, take time to think about the tools you need for your development environment. Spending time setting up your tools and getting them configured can help you be more productive during the project. Don't hesitate to clean up your computer by reinstalling your operating system or uninstalling programs you don't use anymore. In other words, clean out the clutter so you can focus on your projects without getting distracted. Also, take time to learn the tools you will be using, create _very_ simple projects to help you become familiar with tools you haven't used before. Once you know the basics of the tools you will be using, move forward with your larger projects. Having each tool ready and available can make a big difference in letting you focus on the project when you get a few minutes here and there.

When your done you might want to continue with choosing a [Project Management](SubsectionProjectManagement.md) style.
